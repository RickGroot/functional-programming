# Student information
```javascript
const name = "Rick Groot";
const student_nmbr = "N/A";
const school_mail = "rick.groot2@hva.nl";
let age = 19;

let ID_info = {
        year: 2020,
        semester: 1,

};
```

# Research topic
Which cars can and cannot be parked in different parking garages in the Netherlands?

## Required variables
* ID of parking space
* Location of parking garages
* Additional information of parking garages
* Maximumheight
* Data of car types, like height and/or type

## Expectations
I think that lots of parking garages are perfectly compatible with most cars. If you have a van there could be a problem in some parking garages. 

# Concept
A map with all parking garages, with information about capacity and maximum vehicle heights. You can also filter the garages by filtering on your car height or car type.
